This project is mainly developed for Windows since x alreay has this feature.

Now that I've switched to Linux, this project will no longer be maintaied.

# screenshot-pin
Select a region on the screen and pin it on top of all other windows.<br/>
Written in Qt with a minimalistic interface (and also minimal code).<br/>
If you are viewing some documents and want to keep part of it always on your screen for later reference,
then this application will work.<br/>
功能: 截取屏幕某一区域, 然后显示截屏图像, 在其他所有窗口之上.<br/>
背景: 在看书的时候, 可能会有一些东西需要反复参考, 但是又不想一直来回翻页, 所以写的这个应用.<br/>

# Compile
Passed under Windows (Qt 5.7).<br/>
Should work under linux, but minor changes will be necessary.

# Usage
- Left-click the image region: start new screen shot.
- Right-click the image region: close application.
When taking a screen shot
- Left-click and drag: select region
- Right-click: quit

# Todo
- Smaller executable size
- Smaller memory footprint
