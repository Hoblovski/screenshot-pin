# screenshot-pin
Select a region on the screen and pin it on top of all other windows.
Written in Qt with a minimalistic interface (and also minimal code).
If you are viewing some documents and want to keep part of it always on your screen for later reference,
then this application will work.
功能: 截取屏幕某一区域, 然后显示截屏图像, 在其他所有窗口之上.
背景: 在看书的时候, 可能会有一些东西需要反复参考, 但是又不想一直来回翻页, 所以写的这个应用.

# Compile
Passed under Windows (Qt 5.7).
Should work under linux, but minor changes will be necessary.

# Usage
- Left-click the image region: start new screen shot.
- Right-click the image region: close application.
